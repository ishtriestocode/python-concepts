This document will provide you with a brief overview of fundamental concepts in Python, including dictionaries, functions, lists, and tuples.

1. Dictionaries
Dictionaries in Python are collections of key-value pairs. They are mutable, unordered, and indexed.

2. Functions
Functions in Python are blocks of reusable code designed to perform a specific task. They enhance the modularity and reusability of your code.

3. Lists
Lists are ordered collections of items in Python. They are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed. Lists are created by placing comma-separated values inside square brackets.

4. Tuples
Tuples are similar to lists, but they are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation. Tuples are created by placing comma-separated values inside parentheses.
